Welcome to OpenOCD - CMSIS-DAP
==============================

** This repository is no longer maintained. **

CSIS-DAP support is now a pending change to mainline OpenOCD
(http://openocd.zylin.com/1542) 


==============================
==============================

This is a very hacked about version of OpenOCD to support the
ARM CMSIS-DAP interface. 
Very ALPHA at the moment. Feel free to try it out and let me know
what works and what doesn't. Patches for stuff that doesn't work
most welcome.
Absolutely no guarentees at all.... 

========
Support
========

It is assumed that anyone trying this is at least familier with 
building and using OpenOCD. If you need help with that, go to the 
main OpenOCD site - Don't mess with this, chances are it's
broken. You have been warned...

 subscribe to the OpenOCD developer mailing list:
  openocd-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

 or directly:
  mike@theshedworks.org.uk

========
Building 
========

All development up to now has been done on a 64-bit Linux (Debian Wheezy)
machine using the following configuration:

  './configure --enable-maintainer-mode --enable-cmsis-dap'


=======
Running 
=======

Test Hardware is a Freescale FRDM-KL25Z re-programmed with the CMSIS-DAP image.

  'openocd -c "interface cmsis-dap" -f tcl/target/kl25.cfg'
